Yes, this does indeed work. Unfortunately, many people are trained to know that the people that 'break in' are people that are trying to either rob the place of business. But, you know what? I'm Michael, from Microsoft, and I'm here in order to check your network. I'm David from IT, and I'm here in order to check on whether or not you used some unauthorized access software. And a lot of people, will just let you right in, without even contesting you! See: [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Vf3NjTPsI) for more ways on how to get into businesses. There is also another social engineering tool as well.

[URL Shortener using Grabify](https://grabify.link/) People tend to click on links without them knowing. Hence, that will make them reveal their IP address. This can be bypassed by using a VPN.

Additionally: here are also a few things that are not covered in this book.

1. Gain the trust of another individual. This can be done through multiple different ways, including pretending to be an IT professional, or someone that works at Microsoft.

2. Or bully them into giving you their computer.

3. Ask them to share more about themselves, and the lives that they led. More times than not, this will give you more trust, when you are breaking into a company.

Additionally, there are many tools that you could use when trying to go on a social engineering engagement. There are: rubber duckys (found in the next chapter), as well as [cameras in pens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGRJCL7G?psc=1&language=en_US). Social engineering is so powerful, that even in many cases, you could even do it in here. Even just by walking confidently, and not trying to hide behind a wall whenever you see a teacher is infinitely more powerful, because they were not trained to recognize students that are being confident. Some more including playing with the sense of privacy as well. It may be as subtle as choosing an open place outside on a cafe in order to talk to people, or something like seating them next to the place in which they would have a chance to escape (this means making them look at the door). Through these seating arrangements, as well, you build a rapport, as well as give the person a chance to put their best foot forward. 

Social engineering is the fundamental reason why malware hides in files that seem 'too good to be true', like pirated games, and movies (though these can be counteracted by using [bit torrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/)), and also pirated books, and most notably, adult videos and pictures. In fact:

> Almost 90% of attacks are carried out through social engineering. Even if you've got the best security system in the world, and the best encryption scheme that would fry even the best quantum computers of the future, it takes Cathy the secretary to plug in the USB drive that she found, and now, the entire network is compromised. Thanks, Cathy. 

*Remark: Yeah, unfortunately, there are people that store several gigabytes (one author saw over 600 GB) of adult videos. It is far more common than what most people would think.*

**Note that these are going to be joke exercises in order to illustrate the different use cases of hacking. But you get the point. There are several different ways to make the attack go through.**

*Exercise 1: A love letter in the office. Say there is a love letter on somebody's desk. How likely is it that they're going to open it in the 'secure area' that they are in? And then plug in the USB drive, compromising the entire network?*

*Exercise 2: You could ask one of your coworkers (if you've gotten their work phone number), that you are outside, and that you've forgotten your key, and you need to get in the building. You call a person, and then [spoof the phone number](https://smartphones.gadgethacks.com/how-to/make-spoofed-calls-using-any-phone-number-you-want-right-from-your-smartphone-0242383/) to match the work place's phone number, and let them in.* 

*Exercise 3: (Requires RFID copying devices.) Here's a dark story. Imagine that you would want to go and penetrate a business, and a lot of coworkers have their badge out. Now, these particular coworkers, like going to a specific coffee place. Then, as one does, you set up a stand serving coffee claiming to be a representative from the local business, and telling them if they insert their emails, that they would be eligible for a raffle drawing. (and also swipe their badges while they are signing up for a raffle) In particular, it only takes half a second in order to clone these cards, and you'd have access to the building. You'd also have their personal email addresses as well.*

*Exercise 4: Ingress (going in), and Egress (going out) tricks. *

*Remark: It absolutely depends on what context the IP addressed is revealed in. For instance, if it were to be a home network that you were penetrating, an IP address is critical in order to launch further attacks, whereas say when hacking a web application, it doesn't matter all that much, since it is trivial to find. The idea that revealing an IP address is a final blow in all situations is misguided. It is a final blow, if you are being tracked by law enforcement to your own house (since they can just check who owns the IP address, and then check with your ISP.) (more generally, it isn't about the information itself. It's about what you could do what that information.)*
