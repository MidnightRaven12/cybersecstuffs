# Cyber Crime 

Ah yes, cybercrime. A word that strikes fear into the hearts of many in the media, and ends many news reporters into a frenzy. How do children, some of who probably can't even shave yet, crack some large govenrment organization and bring it to its knees? How does a bunch of ragtag Anonymous people on a random forum come together and coordinate DDOS attacks and bring awarness to many of the world's leading issues, while being driven by memes? Cybercrime is given a level of mystery and is romanticized in films, in movies, and in the average video that you see online. It's a way of getting people's attetion quickly, and is one of the main avenues to directly brag about what you have done in the cyber world. In many cases, it is orders of magnitude more profitable to engage in it. From selling scripts to the highest bidder, to engaging in international crimes stealing millions of dollars. 


As penetration testers, you must be intimiately aware of what cybercrime is and the methods that people will use to try to commit it. You must know about adversary emulation, as well as what types of capabilities said adversary will have, and what some APT will focus on and then try to exploit. It isn't exactly all sunshine and rainbows when you're dealing with a cybercrime organization.

## Business Models

There are many different types of cybercrime, in which people will have different objective that you as a penetration tester have to mimic. (or you as a blue teamer have to understand.)

1. Classic.

There's the classic. Cybercriminals cracking an organization to steal money, or trade secrets. Usually, they would have a dedicated botnet or two from infected random computers with malware, with maybe a few DNS domains to their name along the way. They don't necessarily have to be working for some nation state, however, they are usually just people pooling their resources together in order to siphon money out of legitimate businesses. Many times, they engage in ransomware, as well as steal credentials as well as trade secrets on many sites such as PasteBin.  

Additionally, they can create their own malware, and very well pose a threat to the security of networks. But they're limited in funding. They're only got a finite amount of money, unlike:

2. Nation-States

With the rise of cyberwarfare, many nation-states see the importance of protecting their systems, from people within, and from others outside. Many nations, such as the US, UK, China, Russia, North Korea, and virtually most countries you can think of engage in cyber-warfare mainly for espionage. Nation-states might target your company if you're say, Lockheed Martin selling weapons to the US government. Nation-States have the most funding, and can draw on the talents of an entire populace. These are the most difficult to stop, especially because these nations are incredibly secretive about the tools that they use. Things like Stuxnet, as well as Eternal blue, and many others.

3. Hacktivists

Yeah, there are many nuances as to putting it here. But we would like to acknowledge that hacktivism LEGALLY speaking is still technially a cybercrime, regardless of moral stance. Hactivism refers to the act of hacking websites in order to spread a message, such as Anonymous (god that term has been overused...), and many more.  

4. Script Kiddies

Contrary to what the name might imply, this is NOT kids that hack. What it refers to is people that use premade scripts by other people in order to carry out their cyberattacks. These scripts are deveoped by people that are far more talented than them. (maybe people belonging into the classic/nation state category). Script kiddies will usually run scripts without the knowledge to know the gravity of their actions. To them, it may seem like a game, however they have just stolen half a million dollars from a bank account. 

Unfortunately, this is the demographic where many people in the classic/nation-state category try to appeal to. The way that many cybercriminals engage in cybercrime is by the same way that is done in the streets. Have young kids that were alone and desperate for money or attention, then identify them, and then groom them.  (yes Diddy.) Many older cybercriminals look for kids in cracker forums, but they look for them in games, and then talk about how they are part of some group. They look for kids that feel vulnerable and look for kids that know a little bit about cybersecurity, and show some interest in it. They make them feel important, by showing them the things that cybercriminals can do. The power that you could get from just cracking a few government organizations. The family of crackers that believe and think the same way you do. You know, people will always try to find people who they can call family. And money too. The millions and millions of dollars siphoned...a small sum of a hundred grand of that could be yours to keep and spend however you like. How would you like all of that after clicking a few buttons and running a few scripts? How would you like us to teach you how to engage in cybercrime, and immerse you in a secret world where you will fit just right in, even if not perfectly? It could be all yours, kid. 

This is particularly insideous, because just like the criminals of the street, they know the law. Kids will get less harsh sentences, and may even avoid jail time. Kids might have less of a punishment. And well, it's not my fault that this kid want's to hang out with us. We've got our own operations to handle, and a parent trying to bring them to justice will have no way of tracking them. (unless they're idiots.)
