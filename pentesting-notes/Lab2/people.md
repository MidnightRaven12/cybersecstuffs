As society grows ever more connected, one can only assume that it is just a matter of time, before the concept of privacy is something of the past. In this section of notes, we teach you ways in order to accelerate that concept.

1. There is more than just whitepages. Instead, there is also things like truthfinder as well. Note that these are inaccurate, and that these might sometimes be a little bit outdated. Despite this, our authors are not on Whitepages at all, so don't go look for us. Secondly, there are also a few different AI reverse image tools, which allow you to get a person's image. Although these technologies are in its infancy, it won't be that long before someone could feasibly walk up to you on the street and know your information.

Additionally, note that people searching tools can be inaccurate. So it is important to be verifying different information using multiple different sources.

   "Hey, Timmy. How's that crimial trial going for you? I hope you're doing alright in these trying times."

2. [builtwith.com](https://builtwith.com/) Although it may seem tame, this could be a way to enumerate more and more ways to exploit a vulnerability. In particular, one high profile case where Andrew Tate's website used an insecure Javascript Framework (which was open source by the way), for his scam of Hustler's University. Then, the hackers proceeded to [trash the entire website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR5d4Ba4FZg).

Internet archive is also even stronger than it may seem. It could pull up past domains. Even YouTube/Twitter could be reverted to their original state where posts from two years ago could be seen as "original." Using Google maps could also be good, since you might want to be able to get a lay of the physical landscape that you might be pen-testing. You might be able to obtain the floor plan of the building that you are pen-testing.

*Remark: If you're going to be stealing from some open source developer without paying them... you probably deserve to get hacked anyways...*

3. Lastly, there are several more social media sites that show off ways to get in. For example, there are people on social media who flaunt their new badges online. Additionally, there are also several devices in a physical pen-testing scenario that allow you to copy the RFID (think the mechanism) behind the access card. These are so hackable, that many security researchers (including the [Mythbusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-St_ltH90Oc)) are afraid of disclosing it to the public. 

*Remark 2: This is especially true about most modern companies. For instance, credit cards could be hacked, as well as many different types of WiFi networks. Most of the infrastructure that is around us is largely insecure and unregulated.*

## On Ethics

There are a few situations in which you can say that people searching can be good/bad. On one hand, it is technically public knowledge, and it is good to unmask someone who has malintent. On the other, most people don't want to randomly have someone show up at their front door with all of their information. It's a fine balance. 

There are some situations in which it is essential to gather all of the information about the other person. For instance, if you're planning on dating that person, or even associating with them. (This is why social media/privacy) is a contentious part of relationships as well. 

Although we don't exactly condone the use of these privacy tools, it is still *technically* public information. While it is still weird to have someone look you up on the first meet, it is still...legal. 

Generally, if you're not doing someting illegal (like gaining unauthorized access into their router), you're pretty much covered by law.
