There are several tools that are just simply fun to use, as well as very useful especially for penetration testing.

1. [`scapy`](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) This python module is one of the coolest things that are. In particular, using `scapy` allows you to solve the problem of packets being dropped, as well as allowing you to send packets rapidly.

2. [`nishang`](https://www.kali.org/tools/nishang/) A few nice Powershell scripts for post exploitation ;).
