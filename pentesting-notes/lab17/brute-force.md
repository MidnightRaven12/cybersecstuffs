Also, there are some more [`nmap`](https://www.kali.org/tools/nmap/) tricks to use. For instance, `-A`, scans everything, like IP addresses, and every port, and such. Additionally, some other major considerations that you might need are: 

1. Time/Speed of the scan. There are going to be several times in which you are limited by the rate at which you are scanning. For instance, if there is a firewall, which denies access if you scan too quickly, or accidentally DoS's whatever network you are on. there are six flags from `-T<0-5>`, and higher is faster. The default is `-T3`, and you could go faster or slower if you want. There are some cases where it is acceptable to do a full `-T5` scan (such as a very large network that handles a lot of bandwidth and doesn't kick you out), or just your own network. But, very rarely, is it ever going to be used. Instead, maybe try `-T0`, to `-T1`, and spot the difference. (try pinging an entire subnet versus just doing a regular scan of an entire subnet.) 

2. `-sV` and `-sC`. `-sV` lists the services that are running on the system, and `-sC` does some basic scripts as well, like figuring out the ssh public key, and so on and so forth. Usually, `-sV` and `-sC` are usually used to score an easy victory as well by finding a vulnerable service. 

There are also more versatile tools, such as `hydra`, as well. You should go check it out, [here](https://www.kali.org/tools/hydra/)!
