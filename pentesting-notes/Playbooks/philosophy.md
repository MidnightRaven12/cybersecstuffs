(MORE TO ADD AND TO DO!)

The later and later that you get into cybersecurity, it gets to the point in which you figure out which moves to play and why. Cybersecurity is essentially a giant move book with a ton of rules, and things to memorize, with different tradeoffs based on some tools that you have. For instance, a classic `nmap` scan isn't really that high of a risk, (since all you could really do is ban the IP address that "made" the scan), and is really just an annoyance, versus figuring out which techniques that you are replicating, and then having to go back and redo the entire operation. 

Here are four main things to keep track of when it comes to penetration testing (and also threat hunting as well).

1. What even is your target/goal? Are you positively sure that THIS TARGET is the same company? If not, at the very least, you are going to cause some damage to your/your company's reputation, and at the very most, you are going to prison for gross negligence. Are you absolutely sure that this is the domain name?  Are you trying to get some piece of information, or are you just running through a list of vulnerabilities and hoping that some company meets certain standards? 
2. How hard is it to perform? (Think mana) These can range from different tasks, such as running an Nmap scan (1 mana), being able to make a reverse shell and connect to a system (10 mana), creating a botnet in order to DDOS a server, while hiding a few commands as well (100 mana), and then making a rootkit that is dormant on every computer except the ones that Iran is using for their nuclear plants (1000 mana). Let's say that an exploit would involve some use of writing a C++ script specifically for some software that was on the system. If you were making a penetration test where you were really, just looking for low hanging fruit and protecting yourself against script kiddies, you probably wouldn't go this route. (in fact, you most likely wouldn't even be able to list the different software that is on the computer in the first place...)
3. How much time does it take? Some attacks take a short amount of time (like the act of setting up a mass mailer, not the executable file itself), to attacks that would take a long time, like waiting for all of the staff to be away from the office for an extended period of time (think Christmas/New Years break in America, or Chinese New Year in Eastern Countries: see [the Lazarus group's bank heist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery))
4. What are the intentions of the threat actors that you are trying to mitigate against? Are you protecting against people who got mad one day, and researched a few tools to get revenge (think skiddies who just want to smash and grab some information and sell it for a profit), or someone who wants to do serious damage to the institution over a long period of time (Think APTs), or hacktivists that don't even care if they get caught, or even an insider threat that got into your company and can now start to conduct attacks? How do you secure your systems against those? What types of SIEM/EDR systems do you have, and do you implement the principle of least privilege? Is there a finite size for log files? (in which you can simply flood the network with log files to obscure the activity) How possible is it to run things like `nmap -T1 10.0.0.0/24` on the network without getting caught? How possible is it to set up a C2 server, or how possible is it to phish employees? Do they have a mail checker in place? Do they have DMARC and SPF systems to verify their messages, as well as physical security and a way to log people that enter and exit the building?
   
*Remark: Hacktivism is a tricky subject. On the one hand, yeah, of course, you should protest for the things that are injust, and should take down certain websites. Additionally, one could make the argument that nothing cannot change unless there is a large enough action. However, on the other hand, one still shouldn't even do hacktivism because it sets a precedent that if everyone does it, it'll create a dangerous environment where anything can be justified as hacktivism. Don't get me wrong. I'm not someone who is some sort of [droid](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/D/droid.html) who wants to follow the law at all times, because, I'm not. All I'm saying that hacktivism shouldn't be advertised as the so called 'natural' course of action against an entity whenever said entity does something wrong. That's cancel culture. Hacktivism should only be reserved as a last resort, with people that prove to be incorrigible, and prove to not stand for any kind of morals. Hacktivism can only be done with hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people cooperating along, including key people in whatever thing that you are trying to take down.*
