The main aim of this was to introduce different ways to flood an IP address. However, there are a few problems.

1. Organizational (what about chapter 27?)
2. There are also many other flooding mechanisms: including but not limited to, [/auxillary/dos/tcp/synflood](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood.rb), and [hping3](https://www.kali.org/tools/hping3/) There are even DoS attacks that don't even require flooding, such as: [fork bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb), [billion laughs attack/XML bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack), and even the famous [youareanidiot.cc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgs2WTlkp5g) (yt video by the way.)  (in fact, there is a tradition to tell skiddies that talk a lot to run `:(){ :|:& };:` in their linux terminal in order to crash their system)

*Remark: `hping3` is far more powerful than just a `D?DoS` attack mechanism, and can be used to test firewall rules, and is sort of like a mini [nmap](https://nmap.org/). One major instance is a trivial check of firewall rules. In many cases, firewalls block ICMP requests, but not TCP requests. Additionally, using `hping3 -a <your desired IP> <pinged IP>` allows you to spoof the IP address, further allowing you to bypass firewalls. Secondly, you may take this a step further such as: using [`macchanger`](https://www.kali.org/tools/macchanger/), as well. But it has a few drawbacks, as it has no flags, as well as goes to port 0 on the target machine.*
