TODO:

1. Writing malware as well as different weaponization techniques, including [C++](https://www.unknowncheats.me/wiki/C%2B%2B), as well as Python, Bash, Ruby, etc. etc.
2. Metasploit/Meterpreter Shell Tutorial that is far more formal, and actually shows it off in detail (even using mimikatz as well) 
3. A few different forensics techniques as well (because you need to know forensics in order to go and evade it.)
4. C2 Servers and stuff and their insane amounts of power, combined with metasploit, as well as a bunch of other things...
5. The philosophy of a playbook. (See: [example playbook](https://github.com/0xsyr0/Red-Team-Playbooks/blob/master/1-Reconnaissance/1-Reconnaissance.md))
6. Other programming languages.
7. Actual creative stuff to do with computers.
