# Reporting

Yeah, yeah, this is one of the most boring things that you could learn about. However, this is still especially important, as you have to ~~force the other person to understand what's going on and actually take cybersecurity seriously~~ be able to communicate what you have found. 

There are many ways to format your Pentesting reports. One of them that we're familiar with is LaTeX, with a template [here](https://github.com/cyber-cfreg/Penetration-Test-Report-Template). Additionally, you can also write it from scratch. However, the problem is that you would have to write boiler plate code all of the time. 

## The process of RedTeaming...

In order to understand reporting, you must first understand Red Teaming. Namely, what have you done in order to test security controls, as well as what commands you used, so that other people could learn from those commands, and make the report longer to sift through. 

During red teaming, you must take screenshots of the commands that you have put in, as well as the screens that prove that you have obtained the data that you said that you have obtained. These will make the writing process a lot more clear. Additionally, organize it into folders, or some database with some classification. Now, you can find everything with a simple `cd`, or `SELECT * FROM tables`, other than mindlessly running around. Also, name and number your screenshots accordingly so that you can order your document later on. 

Lastly, take some notes during the process of Red Teaming, so that you know what you are going to be writing about the next time you try to open the document. Even a little bit might help refresh your memory. For instance, you might want to jot down the different commands that you used, or the C2 framework that you used, or how you got into their network by Cathy the receptionist opening an obvious phising email. (jk, Cathy. You know we love you.)

Reporting is boring. You don't want to go and add the task of scrambling for your screenshots to it. 

## What is the mindset in making reports (or talking to other non-tech people)? 

There really is no right or wrong answer in how you format your reports except one thing. Your job is to **explain cybersecurity** and how it relates to **business** goals. Will this vulnerability:

a. Lead to a data breach, which would mean fines, and tarnishing of public image?
b. Lead to a denial of service attack, which would mean losing potential revenue?
c. Lead to trade secrets being leaked, which would mean losing market advantage?
d. Leading to data being modified, which would mean backups being lost, and months of lost work. 

Concepts like the CIA triad and a Risk Assessment will help in explaining it. This will help make the executive summary as well as help allocate funds to the proper resources. (or, *let's face it*, whatever's left of the funds.)

*Remark: The sheer scale of large companies means that a few million dollars in data breaches won't deal that much damage. That damage will come with reputation, and relentless roasting on all social medias. Unfortunately, many business leaders are not held accountable for their security for this reason. Powerschool got hacked, and the media barely cared about it, and no one got arrested. Unfortunately, we live in a time where you are above basic decency if you have enough money. And we most likely, always will.*

## What is the mindset in Understanding Reports 

A lot of y'all are going to be in blue teaming, and or some pentesting-adjacent role in cybersecurity. So, it becomes essential to figure out how to understand them, read them, and tolerate them.  

1. **READ**. Yeah, just read. In particular, take notes, and figure out what you need to fix. Please. Just read the document. Just do the work before your information is leaked by some script kiddie with a PoC exploit. 

2. **UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE READING.** You are going to have to figure out how to prioritize which vulnerabilities are going to be fixed. It is your job to figure out which funds need to go to where. The main aim of a report is to translate cybersecurity speak into money speak. 

## Digression on Blame and Implementations (with Personal Experience!)

Being able to communicate your findings might also help in making solutions that will benefit all of the end users. Not being a jerk about cybersecurity goes a long way. From personal experience, every single person behind this account personally never wants to go to IT, because IT is associated with the people that catch you doing something bad or *insecure*, and you'll be told off for it. IT is the nebulous opponent of every person. 

"Oh yeah, IT told us in order to check for phishing emails again."

They'll snoop through your search history, and tell you off about going to those sketchy links again. They'll tell you all about how you'll cost the company a few million dollars, as if *I care.* 

There's a good [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBljl_bi0EM) by Jayson E. Street on this. 

But, I think that it goes far beyond Blue Team kids trying to roast coders and end users. I think it goes for Red Teamers roasting the Blue Teamers, and then Management roasting Red Teamers and lumping them in the same place as pentesters, and then the CEO wondering why they haven't received their $11,299,045.32 bonus.

**"SEVEN DIGITS FOR A BONUS THIS MONTH? WHAT THE *BLEEP* HAPPENED TO THE FIRST ONE? DID YOU EAT IT, ALFRED?"**

But seriously, though. The end users roast IT for getting them in trouble, and IT roasts the end users for not knowing about the things that will leak all of their data. Then within IT, there's developers that are pressured by greedy venture capitalists, then venture capitalists roasted by management, management roasted by the board, and the board roasted by each other. There's also blue team that roasts the end user, red team roasts the blue team, and again, management roasting red team and so on and so forth. 

Developers are not going to code securely just because they want to. Developers probably are pressured by higher ups, which are pressured by changes in the market. A few of us have had experiences where we had to code quickly just to meet deadlines. 

Blue Team is swamped by incidents (especially in education), and a very thin budget brought on by management. Others dealt with management setting their passcodes to a string of identical digits in order to access their phone. (hey kid...did you know the default password for the US Nuclear Codes in the 80s was `000000000`? Sleep well tonight!) Red Team is the same thing, but with an offensive taste to it. 

So, yeah
