It is a fundamental right that we should have privacy. Therefore, we will give a few resources in order to show some ways that you could creatively implement security everywhere.

1. [ssd.eff.org](https://ssd.eff.org/) These are many security tips for almost everyone, and is an essential tool if you're planning to go to protests, as well as different aspects on how to protect yourself. It's a pretty good thing to read up on.

2. Your local state's policies/country. Your rights are on the line! Your freedoms are on the line! Security does not have to just be based on IT. It must also take part in the legal aspect (as much as we hate to write this.) There are several different things to keep track of. For instance, the stand your ground policy, is only ratified in a few states! Additionally, a few of them also may differ on how much they want to disclose to parents, and other caretakers. (Think: [Florida's Don't Say Gay Bill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Parental_Rights_in_Education_Act) or [California's SAFETY Bill (AB 1955)](https://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/ne/yr24/yr24rel37.asp#:~:text=The%20SAFETY%20Act%20provides%20critical,to%20forcibly%20out%20a%20student.)) Additionally, we have the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice), as well as the National Lawyers Guild ([NLG](https://www.nlg.org/)). But generally, you must ALWAYS REQUEST AN ATTORNEY to speak with you. You also have the right to remain silent, and always record officers as to what they are doing. Read up on your amendments, as well as get familiar with the judicial process. Your life may be on the line, even in an ordinary traffic stop, and it is up to you to get the justice that you deserve.
   
3. Insurance/Healthcare, as well as policy madness. Unfortunately, most insurance providers are willing to use tactics that trick ordinary citizens into having them pay for their own medical bills by using undefined terms as well as many pages of policies. There are also a few ways, such as the [glossary for health insurance](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/), [home insurance](https://www.grinnellmutual.com/home-safety-tips-resources/home-insurance-terms-explained), [car insurance](https://www.grinnellmutual.com/auto-safety-tips-resources/car-insurance-terms-explained) as well as your [state insurance departments](https://content.naic.org/state-insurance-departments). Therefore, it is up to you to look up different ways for recourse.

4. GPG messages (for instance through [Kleopatra](https://apps.kde.org/kleopatra/), as well as secret ways of communicating. Here's how to set up a  Even the [FBI wants end to end messaging](https://www.keepersecurity.com/blog/2024/12/31/what-to-know-about-the-fbis-warning-encouraging-encrypted-messaging/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20relying%20on%20insecure,use%20to%20protect%20your%20data.) You should use things such as [Session](https://getsession.org/), rather than Telegram (as Telegram was forced to give [IP addresses and other metadata](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/telegram-agrees-to-share-user-data-with.html))

5. Last but not last, a few ways to make yourself secure. For most people running an iPhone, there is a thing that is known as Lockdown Mode which strips the metadata from the camera. On Android, there is a thing that is known as [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) in order to make your device secure.

   Miscellaneous:

Here are a few miscellaneous ways to get information as well.

1. Police reports are public for a small fee that is generally less than 10 dollars, via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), with a few caveats, but most of the information is still true.
   
2. [The Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/), as well as a few other tools. Additionally, you can also use the Tor Network, **WITH A BRIDGE** in order to hide your internet search history. For some more ways to get more documents, you might want to have [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/), as well as [Z-Lib](https://z-lib.io/), and so on and so forth.

3. There are also many things such as [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) to see whether or not you want to work at a company, or Google's Reverse Image search in order to get information on faces and public posts as well. 

4. If you want to get into the journalism route, you should look at a few things such as the [Secretary of State](https://www.lendingtree.com/business/secretary-of-state-business-search/) in order to look for businesses and their owners as well, or using internet archive in order to revert a site to before something was deleted. For instance, one can use the archive to look at an entirely different version of YouTube, where popular tech youtuber [Marquees Brownlee did go 96 MPH in a 35 MPH school zone!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg09cyX2wss).

5. Lastly, many different courses and resources can be found online based on [MIT Open Courseware](https://www.youtube.com/@mitocw), as well as [Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/@harvard/playlists), and so on and so forth.

*Remark: You can get into the law profession. In fact, you might actually benefit from an advanced knowledge of cybersecurity (or really any field in general). The legal profession spans far more than just people who like to debate over rules. Instead, the legal profession could span over different fields such as the art field (think copyrights, and defamation lawsuits, and Drake). As well as those that are relating to say health (say fighting against health insurance in order to get their payments, as well as helping people interpret their health insurance policies) And you having a niche might make you stand out.*
