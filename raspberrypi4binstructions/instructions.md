<h1>Raspberry Pi 4 Instructions.</h1>

*Hehe. Hi kids, do you want to create a WiFi deauthentication device the size of a playing card?*

Do you wanna go and use a web server in order to remotely interface computers, and carry out WiFi attacks?

Well, you're in luck, welcome to Raspberry Pi 4 instructions!

In this tutorial, we are going to compile all of the links for you, and give you the general guide in order to make your own wifi deauther.

Step 1: Actually, know how to access the Raspberry Pi screen. 

There is a thing that is known as a: [micro HDMI to HDMI converter](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-Ethernet-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B06WWQ7KLV) that you can use in order to interface with the Raspberry Pi 4. Hook it up to any one of the monitors (preferrably the one that is already hooked up, and use it to verify the settings.

Step 2: Brute force (if necessary.) 

Additionally, you might need to brute force the username. So, yeah...might take a bit.

Step 3: Now, for Raspberry Pi 4b, you might also need a breadboard, some buttons, as well as (optionally) an [LCD 16x2 monitor](https://www.amazon.com/16x2-lcd-display/s?k=16x2+lcd+display), and a couple wires. You could find this in the next door room. You will also need to know about the [GPiO module](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO) in Python. There are also a few different videos that help on the topic that you could find anywhere. 

Step 4: Wire your circuit, and program it to execute specific commands when a button is pressed. Profit.
