**Raspberry Pi's are overpowered.** 

Raspberry pis are literally tiny computers that are less than 200 dollars, and are the size of a credit card. They run on Raspberry Pi OS (which is Linux), and can run Web Servers. Additionally, there are many modifications that you can add to Raspberry Pis, including but not limited to:

1. [Raspberry PI NAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l30sADfDiM8) (~around 400 bucks including the Raspberry PI Itself.) 
2. Many different hacking devices (consider [Airodump](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng))
3. Web Servers (and of course, combine with [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/), or maybe [SET](https://trustedsec.com/resources/tools/the-social-engineer-toolkit-set))
4. Security Cameras, using [this site.](https://www.nabto.com/build-raspberry-pi-security-camera/)
